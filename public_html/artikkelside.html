                            An article review is both a summary and an 
                            evaluation of another writer's article. 
                            Teachers

                            Experts also are often asked to review the work 
                            of other professionals. Understanding the main 
                            points and arguments of the article is essential 
                            for an accurate summation. Logical evaluation of the 
                            article's main theme, supporting arguments and 
                            implications for further research is an important
                            element of a review. Here are a few guidelines 
                            for writing an article review.
