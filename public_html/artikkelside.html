                            You can add borders to HTML scroll boxes using 
                            the CSS 'border' property. Borders can be of 
                            any thickness, and any color. You can specify 
                            whether it's solid, dotted, dashed, and more. 
                            You can also specify a different border for each
                            side of your scroll box.</div>
